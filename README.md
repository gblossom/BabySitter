# BabySitter
Pillar Babysitter Kata

Background
This kata simulates a babysitter working and getting paid for one night. The rules are pretty straight forward.

The babysitter:
  starts no earlier than 5:00PM
  leaves no later than 4:00AM
  gets paid $12/hour from start-time to bedtime
  gets paid $8/hour from bedtime to midnight
  gets paid $16/hour from midnight to end of job
  gets paid for full hours (no fractional hours)
Feature
  As a babysitter
  In order to get paid for 1 night of work
  I want to calculate my nightly charge


This application was created using Visual Studio Community 2017 version 15.8.1 creating a Console App.

I know the instructions are very clear about making sure all of my dependencies are included in this git repository
  BUT I have never used github before and I don't know everything that needs to be included. I have uploaded the two
  C# filoes containing the BabySitter (Program.cs) and UnitTest1 (UnitTest1.cs) classes. I am pretty sure that there
  are more files required to actually build it.

Some feedback at this point would be appreciated to make sure I get you ALL of the files that are required.
